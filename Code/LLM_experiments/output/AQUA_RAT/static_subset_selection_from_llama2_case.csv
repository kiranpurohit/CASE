Like {( 2,3,5) , ( 5,12,13) ,( 7, 24,25), ( 11, 60,61).
So now we know the triangle is an right angle triangle. The circle circumscribes the triangle.
The circumraduis of the circle that circumscribes the right angle triangle = hypotanse / 2 = 61 / 2 = 30.5

49384,"If the average (arithmetic mean) of five consecutive negative integers is 2k – 1, what is the difference V between the greatest and least of the five integers?","['A)4K', 'B)4k^2 -4k', 'C)4-4k', 'D)4', 'E)4k+4']","(n-2 + n - 1 + n + n + 1 + n + 2)/5 = 2k - 1
=> n = 10k - 5
Greatest = n + 2 = 10k - 5 + 2 = 10k - 3
Least = n - 2 = 10k - 5 - 2
=> Difference V= 10k - 3 - (10k - 7)
= 4
