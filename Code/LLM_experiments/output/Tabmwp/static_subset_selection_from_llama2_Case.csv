To find the probability that a friend preferred organic and tasted peaches, first identify the sample space and the event.
The outcomes in the sample space are the different friends. Each friend is equally likely to be selected, so this is a uniform probability model.
The event is A and B, ""the friend preferred organic and tasted peaches"".
Since this is a uniform probability model, count the number of outcomes in the event A and B and count the total number of outcomes. Then, divide them to compute the probability.

Find the number of outcomes in the event A and B.
A and B is the event ""the friend preferred organic and tasted peaches"", so look at the table to see how many friends preferred organic and tasted peaches.
The number of friends who preferred organic and tasted peaches is 7.

Find the total number of outcomes.
Add all the numbers in the table to find the total number of friends.
2 + 7 + 7 + 3 = 19

Find P(A and B).
Since all outcomes are equally likely, the probability of event A and B is the number of outcomes in event A and B divided by the total number of outcomes.
P(A and B) = \frac{# of outcomes in A and B}{total # of outcomes}
 = \frac{7}{19}
