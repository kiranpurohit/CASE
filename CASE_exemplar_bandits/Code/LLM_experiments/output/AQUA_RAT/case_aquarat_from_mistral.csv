In every 3 consecutive integers, there must contain 1 multiple of 3.
So n+4 and n+1 are same if we need to find out the 3's multiple. replace all the numbers which are more than or equal to three
1. n (n+1) (n-4) = > n(n+1)(n-1) = > (n-1)n(n+1)
2. n (n+2) (n-1) = > n(n+2)(n-1) = > (n-1)n(n+1)
3. n (n+3) (n-5) = > n(n+0)(n-2) = > (n-2)n(n)
4. n (n+4) (n-2) = > n(n+1)(n-2) = > (n-2)n(n+1)
5. n (n+5) (n-6) = > n(n+2)(n-0) = > (n)n(n+2)
from the above onlyoption Ais product of consecutive three numbers.

16632,"A merchant gains or loses, in a bargain, a certain sum. In a second bargain, he gains 280 dollars, and, in a third, loses 20. In the end he finds he has gained 120 dollars, by the three together. How much did he gain or lose bv the first ?","['A)80', 'B)-140', 'C)140', 'D)120', 'E)None']","In this sum, as the profit and loss are opposite in their nature, they must be distinguished by contrary signs. If the profit is marked +, the loss must be -.
Let x = the sum required.
Then according to the statement x + 280 - 20 = 120
And x = -140.

88770,"P is 30% more efficient than Q. P can complete a work in 23 days. If P and Q work together, how much time will it take to complete the same work?","['A)9', 'B)11', 'C)13', 'D)15', 'E)17']","Explanation :
Work done by P in 1 day = 1/23
Let work done by Q in 1 day = q
q × (130/100) = 1/23
=> q = 100/(23×130) = 10/(23×13)
Work done by P and Q in 1 day = 1/23 + 10/(23×13) = 23/(23×13)= 1/13
=> P and Q together can do the work in 13 days

80165,How many prime numbers are between 29/4 and 87/5?,"['A)1', 'B)2', 'C)3', 'D)4', 'E)5']","29/4 = 7.xxx
87/5 = 17.xxx
So we need to find Prime numbers between 7 (Exclusive) - 16 (Inclusive)
There are 2 Prime numbers 1113
Hence answer will be (B) 2

6239,Find the numbers which are in the ratio 3:2:2 such that the sum of the first and the second added to the difference of the third and the second is 20?,"['A)12,8,8', 'B)4,4,22', 'C)9,3,32', 'D)9,6,12', 'E)9,2,23']","Let the numbers be a, b and c.
a:b:c = 3:2:2
Given, (a + b) + (c - b) = 20
=> a + c = 20
=> 3x + 2x = 20 => x =4
a, b, c are 3x, 2x, 2x
a, b, c are 12, 8, 8.

93033,A sum of money at simple interest amounts to Rs. 825 in 3 years and to Rs. 850 in 4 years. The sum is?,"['A)s. 738', 'B)s. 750', 'C)s. 650', 'D)s. 730', 'E)s. 735']","S.I. for 1 year = (850 - 825) = Rs. 25
S.I. for 3 years = 25 * 3 = Rs. 75
Principal = (825 - 75) = Rs. 750.
