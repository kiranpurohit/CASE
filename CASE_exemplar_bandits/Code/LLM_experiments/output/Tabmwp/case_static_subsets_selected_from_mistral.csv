To find the probability that a beanbag chair is made from suede and is filled with beads, first identify the sample space and the event.
The outcomes in the sample space are the different beanbag chairs. Each beanbag chair is equally likely to be selected, so this is a uniform probability model.
The event is A and B, ""the beanbag chair is made from suede and is filled with beads"".
Since this is a uniform probability model, count the number of outcomes in the event A and B and count the total number of outcomes. Then, divide them to compute the probability.

Find the number of outcomes in the event A and B.
A and B is the event ""the beanbag chair is made from suede and is filled with beads"", so look at the table to see how many beanbag chairs are made from suede and are filled with beads.
The number of beanbag chairs that are made from suede and are filled with beads is 4.

Find the total number of outcomes.
Add all the numbers in the table to find the total number of beanbag chairs.
4 + 5 + 6 + 4 = 19

Find P(A and B).
Since all outcomes are equally likely, the probability of event A and B is the number of outcomes in event A and B divided by the total number of outcomes.
P(A and B) = \frac{# of outcomes in A and B}{total # of outcomes}
