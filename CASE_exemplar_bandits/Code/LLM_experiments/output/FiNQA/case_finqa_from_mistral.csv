5548,what percentage of total net revenues in the institutional client services segment was due to fixed income currency and commodities client execution in 2015?,48%,"the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries management 2019s discussion and analysis equities . includes client execution activities related to making markets in equity products and commissions and fees from executing and clearing institutional client transactions on major stock , options and futures exchanges worldwide , as well as otc transactions . equities also includes our securities services business , which provides financing , securities lending and other prime brokerage services to institutional clients , including hedge funds , mutual funds , pension funds and foundations , and generates revenues primarily in the form of interest rate spreads or fees . the table below presents the operating results of our institutional client services segment. . 1 . net revenues related to the americas reinsurance business were $ 317 million for 2013 . in april 2013 , we completed the sale of a majority stake in our americas reinsurance business and no longer consolidate this business . 2015 versus 2014 . net revenues in institutional client services were $ 15.15 billion for 2015 , essentially unchanged compared with 2014 . net revenues in fixed income , currency and commodities client execution were $ 7.32 billion for 2015 , 13% ( 13 % ) lower than 2014 . excluding a gain of $ 168 million in 2014 related to the extinguishment of certain of our junior subordinated debt , net revenues in fixed income , currency and commodities client execution were 12% ( 12 % ) lower than 2014 , reflecting significantly lower net revenues in mortgages , credit products and commodities . the decreases in mortgages and credit products reflected challenging market-making conditions and generally low levels of activity during 2015 . the decline in commodities primarily reflected less favorable market-making conditions compared with 2014 , which included a strong first quarter of 2014 . these decreases were partially offset by significantly higher net revenues in interest rate products and currencies , reflecting higher volatility levels which contributed to higher client activity levels , particularly during the first quarter of 2015 . net revenues in equities were $ 7.83 billion for 2015 , 16% ( 16 % ) higher than 2014 . excluding a gain of $ 121 million ( $ 30 million and $ 91 million included in equities client execution and securities services , respectively ) in 2014 related to the extinguishment of certain of our junior subordinated debt , net revenues in equities were 18% ( 18 % ) higher than 2014 , primarily due to significantly higher net revenues in equities client execution across the major regions , reflecting significantly higher results in both derivatives and cash products , and higher net revenues in securities services , reflecting the impact of higher average customer balances and improved securities lending spreads . commissions and fees were essentially unchanged compared with 2014 . the firm elects the fair value option for certain unsecured borrowings . the fair value net gain attributable to the impact of changes in our credit spreads on these borrowings was $ 255 million ( $ 214 million and $ 41 million related to fixed income , currency and commodities client execution and equities client execution , respectively ) for 2015 , compared with a net gain of $ 144 million ( $ 108 million and $ 36 million related to fixed income , currency and commodities client execution and equities client execution , respectively ) for 2014 . during 2015 , the operating environment for institutional client services was positively impacted by diverging central bank monetary policies in the united states and the euro area in the first quarter , as increased volatility levels contributed to strong client activity levels in currencies , interest rate products and equity products , and market- making conditions improved . however , during the remainder of the year , concerns about global growth and uncertainty about the u.s . federal reserve 2019s interest rate policy , along with lower global equity prices , widening high-yield credit spreads and declining commodity prices , contributed to lower levels of client activity , particularly in mortgages and credit , and more difficult market-making conditions . if macroeconomic concerns continue over the long term and activity levels decline , net revenues in institutional client services would likely be negatively impacted . operating expenses were $ 13.94 billion for 2015 , 28% ( 28 % ) higher than 2014 , due to significantly higher net provisions for mortgage-related litigation and regulatory matters , partially offset by decreased compensation and benefits expenses . pre-tax earnings were $ 1.21 billion in 2015 , 72% ( 72 % ) lower than 2014 . 62 goldman sachs

2022 at the lower of cost or fair value , with valuation changes record- ed in noninterest revenue , for loans that are classified as held- for-sale ; or 2022 at fair value , with changes in fair value recorded in noninterest revenue , for loans classified as trading assets or risk managed on a fair value basis ; 2022 purchased credit-impaired loans held for investment are account- ed for under sop 03-3 and initially measured at fair value , which includes estimated future credit losses . accordingly , an allowance for loan losses related to these loans is not recorded at the acquisition date . see note 5 on pages 156 2013158 of this annual report for further information on the firm 2019s elections of fair value accounting under sfas 159 . see note 6 on pages 158 2013160 of this annual report for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets . for loans held for investment , other than purchased credit-impaired loans , interest income is recognized using the interest method or on a basis approximating a level rate of return over the term of the loan . loans within the held-for-investment portfolio that management decides to sell are transferred to the held-for-sale portfolio . transfers to held-for-sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer . credit-related losses are charged off to the allowance for loan losses and losses due to changes in interest rates , or exchange rates , are recognized in noninterest revenue . loans within the held-for-sale portfolio that management decides to retain are transferred to the held-for-investment portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value . these loans are subsequently assessed for impairment based on the firm 2019s allowance methodology . for a fur- ther discussion of the methodologies used in establishing the firm 2019s allowance for loan losses , see note 15 on pages 178 2013180 of this annual report . nonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest is dis- continued . loans ( other than certain consumer and purchased credit- impaired loans discussed below ) are placed on nonaccrual status immediately if , in the opinion of management , full payment of princi- pal or interest is in doubt , or when principal or interest is 90 days or more past due and collateral , if any , is insufficient to cover principal and interest . loans are charged off to the allowance for loan losses when it is highly certain that a loss has been realized . interest accrued but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is reversed against interest income . in addition , the amortiza- tion of net deferred loan fees is suspended . interest income on nonaccrual loans is recognized only to the extent it is received in cash . however , where there is doubt regarding the ultimate col- lectibility of loan principal , all cash thereafter received is applied to reduce the carrying value of such loans ( i.e. , the cost recovery method ) . loans are restored to accrual status only when future pay- ments of interest and principal are reasonably assured . consumer loans , other than purchased credit-impaired loans , are generally charged to the allowance for loan losses upon reaching specified stages of delinquency , in accordance with the federal financial institutions examination council policy . for example , credit card loans are charged off by the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days past due or within 60 days from receiv- ing notification of the filing of bankruptcy , whichever is earlier . residential mortgage products are generally charged off to net real- izable value at no later than 180 days past due . other consumer .","december 31 ( in millions ) | 2008 | 2007 |

5096,what was the percentage change in the non interest income from from 2011 to 2012,5.4%,"consolidated income statement review our consolidated income statement is presented in item 8 of this report . net income for 2012 was $ 3.0 billion compared with $ 3.1 billion for 2011 . revenue growth of 8 percent and a decline in the provision for credit losses were more than offset by a 16 percent increase in noninterest expense in 2012 compared to 2011 . further detail is included in the net interest income , noninterest income , provision for credit losses and noninterest expense portions of this consolidated income statement review . net interest income table 2 : net interest income and net interest margin year ended december 31 dollars in millions 2012 2011 . changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction of the volume and composition of interest-earning assets and related yields , interest-bearing liabilities and related rates paid , and noninterest-bearing sources of funding . see the statistical information ( unaudited ) 2013 average consolidated balance sheet and net interest analysis and analysis of year-to-year changes in net interest income in item 8 of this report and the discussion of purchase accounting accretion of purchased impaired loans in the consolidated balance sheet review in this item 7 for additional information . the increase in net interest income in 2012 compared with 2011 was primarily due to the impact of the rbc bank ( usa ) acquisition , organic loan growth and lower funding costs . purchase accounting accretion remained stable at $ 1.1 billion in both periods . the net interest margin was 3.94% ( 3.94 % ) for 2012 and 3.92% ( 3.92 % ) for 2011 . the increase in the comparison was primarily due to a decrease in the weighted-average rate accrued on total interest- bearing liabilities of 29 basis points , largely offset by a 21 basis point decrease on the yield on total interest-earning assets . the decrease in the rate on interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to the runoff of maturing retail certificates of deposit and the redemption of additional trust preferred and hybrid capital securities during 2012 , in addition to an increase in fhlb borrowings and commercial paper as lower-cost funding sources . the decrease in the yield on interest-earning assets was primarily due to lower rates on new loan volume and lower yields on new securities in the current low rate environment . with respect to the first quarter of 2013 , we expect net interest income to decline by two to three percent compared to fourth quarter 2012 net interest income of $ 2.4 billion , due to a decrease in purchase accounting accretion of up to $ 50 to $ 60 million , including lower expected cash recoveries . for the full year 2013 , we expect net interest income to decrease compared with 2012 , assuming an expected decline in purchase accounting accretion of approximately $ 400 million , while core net interest income is expected to increase in the year-over-year comparison . we believe our net interest margin will come under pressure in 2013 , due to the expected decline in purchase accounting accretion and assuming that the current low rate environment continues . noninterest income noninterest income totaled $ 5.9 billion for 2012 and $ 5.6 billion for 2011 . the overall increase in the comparison was primarily due to an increase in residential mortgage loan sales revenue driven by higher loan origination volume , gains on sales of visa class b common shares and higher corporate service fees , largely offset by higher provision for residential mortgage repurchase obligations . asset management revenue , including blackrock , totaled $ 1.2 billion in 2012 compared with $ 1.1 billion in 2011 . this increase was primarily due to higher earnings from our blackrock investment . discretionary assets under management increased to $ 112 billion at december 31 , 2012 compared with $ 107 billion at december 31 , 2011 driven by stronger average equity markets , positive net flows and strong sales performance . for 2012 , consumer services fees were $ 1.1 billion compared with $ 1.2 billion in 2011 . the decline reflected the regulatory impact of lower interchange fees on debit card transactions partially offset by customer growth . as further discussed in the retail banking portion of the business segments review section of this item 7 , the dodd-frank limits on interchange rates were effective october 1 , 2011 and had a negative impact on revenue of approximately $ 314 million in 2012 and $ 75 million in 2011 . this impact was partially offset by higher volumes of merchant , customer credit card and debit card transactions and the impact of the rbc bank ( usa ) acquisition . corporate services revenue increased by $ .3 billion , or 30 percent , to $ 1.2 billion in 2012 compared with $ .9 billion in 2011 due to higher commercial mortgage servicing revenue and higher merger and acquisition advisory fees in 2012 . the major components of corporate services revenue are treasury management revenue , corporate finance fees , including revenue from capital markets-related products and services , and commercial mortgage servicing revenue , including commercial mortgage banking activities . see the product

however , the company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk . in addition , when possible , the company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing , loans or leases to support credit exposure . these credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer . as such , the company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements . as of september 26 , 2015 , the company had one customer that represented 10% ( 10 % ) or more of total trade receivables , which accounted for 12% ( 12 % ) . as of september 27 , 2014 , the company had two customers that represented 10% ( 10 % ) or more of total trade receivables , one of which accounted for 16% ( 16 % ) and the other 13% ( 13 % ) . the company 2019s cellular network carriers accounted for 71% ( 71 % ) and 72% ( 72 % ) of trade receivables as of september 26 , 2015 and september 27 , 2014 , respectively . vendor non-trade receivables the company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the company . the company purchases these components directly from suppliers . vendor non-trade receivables from three of the company 2019s vendors accounted for 38% ( 38 % ) , 18% ( 18 % ) and 14% ( 14 % ) of total vendor non-trade receivables as of september 26 , 2015 and three of the company 2019s vendors accounted for 51% ( 51 % ) , 16% ( 16 % ) and 14% ( 14 % ) of total vendor non-trade receivables as of september 27 , 2014 . note 3 2013 consolidated financial statement details the following tables show the company 2019s consolidated financial statement details as of september 26 , 2015 and september 27 , 2014 ( in millions ) : property , plant and equipment , net . apple inc . | 2015 form 10-k | 53 ."," | 2015 | 2014 |

3556,in 2008 what was the ratio of the citigroup parent company to the other citigroup subsidiaries long-term debt,1.76,"sources of liquidity primary sources of liquidity for citigroup and its principal subsidiaries include : 2022 deposits ; 2022 collateralized financing transactions ; 2022 senior and subordinated debt ; 2022 commercial paper ; 2022 trust preferred and preferred securities ; and 2022 purchased/wholesale funds . citigroup 2019s funding sources are diversified across funding types and geography , a benefit of its global franchise . funding for citigroup and its major operating subsidiaries includes a geographically diverse retail and corporate deposit base of $ 774.2 billion . these deposits are diversified across products and regions , with approximately two-thirds of them outside of the u.s . this diversification provides the company with an important , stable and low-cost source of funding . a significant portion of these deposits has been , and is expected to be , long-term and stable , and are considered to be core . there are qualitative as well as quantitative assessments that determine the company 2019s calculation of core deposits . the first step in this process is a qualitative assessment of the deposits . for example , as a result of the company 2019s qualitative analysis certain deposits with wholesale funding characteristics are excluded from consideration as core . deposits that qualify under the company 2019s qualitative assessments are then subjected to quantitative analysis . excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and the sale of our retail banking operations in germany during the year ending december 31 , 2008 , the company 2019s deposit base remained stable . on a volume basis , deposit increases were noted in transaction services , u.s . retail banking and smith barney . this was partially offset by the company 2019s decision to reduce deposits considered wholesale funding , consistent with the company 2019s de-leveraging efforts , and declines in international consumer banking and the private bank . citigroup and its subsidiaries have historically had a significant presence in the global capital markets . the company 2019s capital markets funding activities have been primarily undertaken by two legal entities : ( i ) citigroup inc. , which issues long-term debt , medium-term notes , trust preferred securities , and preferred and common stock ; and ( ii ) citigroup funding inc . ( cfi ) , a first-tier subsidiary of citigroup , which issues commercial paper , medium-term notes and structured equity-linked and credit-linked notes , all of which are guaranteed by citigroup . other significant elements of long- term debt on the consolidated balance sheet include collateralized advances from the federal home loan bank system , long-term debt related to the consolidation of icg 2019s structured investment vehicles , asset-backed outstandings , and certain borrowings of foreign subsidiaries . each of citigroup 2019s major operating subsidiaries finances its operations on a basis consistent with its capitalization , regulatory structure and the environment in which it operates . particular attention is paid to those businesses that for tax , sovereign risk , or regulatory reasons cannot be freely and readily funded in the international markets . citigroup 2019s borrowings have historically been diversified by geography , investor , instrument and currency . decisions regarding the ultimate currency and interest rate profile of liquidity generated through these borrowings can be separated from the actual issuance through the use of derivative instruments . citigroup is a provider of liquidity facilities to the commercial paper programs of the two primary credit card securitization trusts with which it transacts . citigroup may also provide other types of support to the trusts . as a result of the recent economic downturn , its impact on the cashflows of the trusts , and in response to credit rating agency reviews of the trusts , the company increased the credit enhancement in the omni trust , and plans to provide additional enhancement to the master trust ( see note 23 to consolidated financial statements on page 175 for a further discussion ) . this support preserves investor sponsorship of our card securitization franchise , an important source of liquidity . banking subsidiaries there are various legal limitations on the ability of citigroup 2019s subsidiary depository institutions to extend credit , pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to citigroup and its non-bank subsidiaries . the approval of the office of the comptroller of the currency , in the case of national banks , or the office of thrift supervision , in the case of federal savings banks , is required if total dividends declared in any calendar year exceed amounts specified by the applicable agency 2019s regulations . state-chartered depository institutions are subject to dividend limitations imposed by applicable state law . in determining the declaration of dividends , each depository institution must also consider its effect on applicable risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements , as well as policy statements of the federal regulatory agencies that indicate that banking organizations should generally pay dividends out of current operating earnings . non-banking subsidiaries citigroup also receives dividends from its non-bank subsidiaries . these non-bank subsidiaries are generally not subject to regulatory restrictions on dividends . however , as discussed in 201ccapital resources and liquidity 201d on page 94 , the ability of cgmhi to declare dividends can be restricted by capital considerations of its broker-dealer subsidiaries . cgmhi 2019s consolidated balance sheet is liquid , with the vast majority of its assets consisting of marketable securities and collateralized short-term financing agreements arising from securities transactions . cgmhi monitors and evaluates the adequacy of its capital and borrowing base on a daily basis to maintain liquidity and to ensure that its capital base supports the regulatory capital requirements of its subsidiaries . some of citigroup 2019s non-bank subsidiaries , including cgmhi , have credit facilities with citigroup 2019s subsidiary depository institutions , including citibank , n.a . borrowings under these facilities must be secured in accordance with section 23a of the federal reserve act . there are various legal restrictions on the extent to which a bank holding company and certain of its non-bank subsidiaries can borrow or obtain credit from citigroup 2019s subsidiary depository institutions or engage in certain other transactions with them . in general , these restrictions require that transactions be on arm 2019s length terms and be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral . see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements on page 169 . at december 31 , 2008 , long-term debt and commercial paper outstanding for citigroup , cgmhi , cfi and citigroup 2019s subsidiaries were as follows : in billions of dollars citigroup parent company cgmhi ( 2 ) citigroup funding inc .
