4272,what was the percent of the net gains and losses from cva and hedges of cva ( a ),59.1%,"management 2019s discussion and analysis 128 jpmorgan chase & co./2010 annual report year ended december 31 . ( a ) these hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting under u.s . gaap . lending-related commitments jpmorgan chase uses lending-related financial instruments , such as commitments and guarantees , to meet the financing needs of its customers . the contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk should the counterpar- ties draw down on these commitments or the firm fulfills its obliga- tion under these guarantees , and should the counterparties subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these con- tracts . wholesale lending-related commitments were $ 346.1 billion at december 31 , 2010 , compared with $ 347.2 billion at december 31 , 2009 . the decrease reflected the january 1 , 2010 , adoption of accounting guidance related to vies . excluding the effect of the accounting guidance , lending-related commitments would have increased by $ 16.6 billion . in the firm 2019s view , the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is not representative of the firm 2019s actual credit risk exposure or funding requirements . in determining the amount of credit risk exposure the firm has to wholesale lend- ing-related commitments , which is used as the basis for allocating credit risk capital to these commitments , the firm has established a 201cloan-equivalent 201d amount for each commitment ; this amount represents the portion of the unused commitment or other contin- gent exposure that is expected , based on average portfolio histori- cal experience , to become drawn upon in an event of a default by an obligor . the loan-equivalent amounts of the firm 2019s lending- related commitments were $ 189.9 billion and $ 179.8 billion as of december 31 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively . country exposure the firm 2019s wholesale portfolio includes country risk exposures to both developed and emerging markets . the firm seeks to diversify its country exposures , including its credit-related lending , trading and investment activities , whether cross-border or locally funded . country exposure under the firm 2019s internal risk management ap- proach is reported based on the country where the assets of the obligor , counterparty or guarantor are located . exposure amounts , including resale agreements , are adjusted for collateral and for credit enhancements ( e.g. , guarantees and letters of credit ) pro- vided by third parties ; outstandings supported by a guarantor located outside the country or backed by collateral held outside the country are assigned to the country of the enhancement provider . in addition , the effect of credit derivative hedges and other short credit or equity trading positions are taken into consideration . total exposure measures include activity with both government and private-sector entities in a country . the firm also reports country exposure for regulatory purposes following ffiec guidelines , which are different from the firm 2019s internal risk management approach for measuring country expo- sure . for additional information on the ffiec exposures , see cross- border outstandings on page 314 of this annual report . several european countries , including greece , portugal , spain , italy and ireland , have been subject to credit deterioration due to weak- nesses in their economic and fiscal situations . the firm is closely monitoring its exposures to these five countries . aggregate net exposures to these five countries as measured under the firm 2019s internal approach was less than $ 15.0 billion at december 31 , 2010 , with no country representing a majority of the exposure . sovereign exposure in all five countries represented less than half the aggregate net exposure . the firm currently believes its exposure to these five countries is modest relative to the firm 2019s overall risk expo- sures and is manageable given the size and types of exposures to each of the countries and the diversification of the aggregate expo- sure . the firm continues to conduct business and support client activity in these countries and , therefore , the firm 2019s aggregate net exposures may vary over time . in addition , the net exposures may be impacted by changes in market conditions , and the effects of interest rates and credit spreads on market valuations . as part of its ongoing country risk management process , the firm monitors exposure to emerging market countries , and utilizes country stress tests to measure and manage the risk of extreme loss associated with a sovereign crisis . there is no common definition of emerging markets , but the firm generally includes in its definition those countries whose sovereign debt ratings are equivalent to 201ca+ 201d or lower . the table below presents the firm 2019s exposure to its top 10 emerging markets countries based on its internal measure- ment approach . the selection of countries is based solely on the firm 2019s largest total exposures by country and does not represent its view of any actual or potentially adverse credit conditions. .","( in millions ) | 2010 | 2009 | 2008 |

security solution activities in 2009 compared to 2008 . the increase in defense 2019s operating profit of $ 29 million mainly was due to volume and improved performance in mission and combat systems . the decrease in backlog during 2010 compared to 2009 mainly was due to higher sales volume on enterprise civilian service programs at civil , including volume associated with the dris 2010 program , and mission and combat system programs at defense . backlog decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 due to u.s . government 2019s exercise of the termination for convenience clause on the tsat mission operations system ( tmos ) contract at defense , which resulted in a $ 1.6 billion reduction in orders . this decline more than offset increased orders on enterprise civilian services programs at civil . we expect is&gs will experience a low single digit percentage decrease in sales for 2011 as compared to 2010 . this decline primarily is due to completion of most of the work associated with the dris 2010 program . operating profit in 2011 is expected to decline in relationship to the decline in sales volume , while operating margins are expected to be comparable between the years . space systems our space systems business segment is engaged in the design , research and development , engineering , and production of satellites , strategic and defensive missile systems , and space transportation systems , including activities related to the planned replacement of the space shuttle . government satellite programs include the advanced extremely high frequency ( aehf ) system , the mobile user objective system ( muos ) , the global positioning satellite iii ( gps iii ) system , the space-based infrared system ( sbirs ) , and the geostationary operational environmental satellite r-series ( goes-r ) . strategic and missile defense programs include the targets and countermeasures program and the fleet ballistic missile program . space transportation includes the nasa orion program and , through ownership interests in two joint ventures , expendable launch services ( united launch alliance , or ula ) and space shuttle processing activities for the u.s . government ( united space alliance , or usa ) . the space shuttle is expected to complete its final flight mission in 2011 and our involvement with its launch and processing activities will end at that time . space systems 2019 operating results included the following : ( in millions ) 2010 2009 2008 . net sales for space systems decreased by 5% ( 5 % ) in 2010 compared to 2009 . sales declined in all three lines of business during the year . the $ 253 million decrease in space transportation principally was due to lower volume on the space shuttle external tank , commercial launch vehicle activity and other human space flight programs , which partially were offset by higher volume on the orion program . there were no commercial launches in 2010 compared to one commercial launch in 2009 . strategic & defensive missile systems ( s&dms ) sales declined $ 147 million principally due to lower volume on defensive missile programs . the $ 8 million sales decline in satellites primarily was attributable to lower volume on commercial satellites , which partially were offset by higher volume on government satellite activities . there was one commercial satellite delivery in 2010 and one commercial satellite delivery in 2009 . net sales for space systems increased 8% ( 8 % ) in 2009 compared to 2008 . during the year , sales growth at satellites and space transportation offset a decline in s&dms . the sales growth of $ 707 million in satellites was due to higher volume in government satellite activities , which partially was offset by lower volume in commercial satellite activities . there was one commercial satellite delivery in 2009 and two deliveries in 2008 . the increase in sales of $ 21 million in space transportation primarily was due to higher volume on the orion program , which more than offset a decline in the space shuttle 2019s external tank program . there was one commercial launch in both 2009 and 2008 . s&dms 2019 sales decreased by $ 102 million mainly due to lower volume on defensive missile programs , which more than offset growth in strategic missile programs. .","( in millions ) | 2010 | 2009 | 2008 |

2778,inn 2003 what was the percent of the total rental income by reportable segment that was sourced from retail,0.85%,"gain on land sales are derived from sales of undeveloped land owned by us . we pursue opportunities to dispose of land in markets with a high concentration of undeveloped land and in those markets where the land no longer meets our strategic development plans . the increase was partially attributable to a land sale to a current corporate tenant for potential future expansion . we recorded $ 424000 and $ 560000 of impairment charges associated with contracts to sell land parcels for the years ended december 31 , 2004 and 2003 , respectively . as of december 31 , 2004 , only one parcel on which we recorded impairment charges is still owned by us . we anticipate selling this parcel in the first quarter of 2005 . discontinued operations we have classified operations of 86 buildings as discontinued operations as of december 31 , 2004 . these 86 buildings consist of 69 industrial , 12 office and five retail properties . as a result , we classified net income from operations , net of minority interest , of $ 1.6 million , $ 6.3 million and $ 10.7 million as net income from discontinued operations for the years ended december 31 , 2004 , 2003 and 2002 , respectively . in addition , 41 of the properties classified in discontinued operations were sold during 2004 , 42 properties were sold during 2003 , two properties were sold during 2002 and one operating property is classified as held-for-sale at december 31 , 2004 . the gains on disposal of these properties , net of impairment adjustment and minority interest , of $ 23.9 million and $ 11.8 million for the years ended december 31 , 2004 and 2003 , respectively , are also reported in discontinued operations . for the year ended december 31 , 2002 , a $ 4.5 million loss on disposal of properties , net of impairment adjustments and minority interest , is reported in discontinued operations due to impairment charges of $ 7.7 million recorded on three properties in 2002 that were later sold in 2003 and 2004 . comparison of year ended december 31 , 2003 to year ended december 31 , 2002 rental income from continuing operations rental income from continuing operations increased from $ 652.8 million in 2002 to $ 689.3 million in 2003 . the following table reconciles rental income by reportable segment to our total reported rental income from continuing operations for the years ended december 31 , 2003 and 2002 ( in thousands ) : . although our three reportable segments comprising rental operations ( office , industrial and retail ) are all within the real estate industry , they are not necessarily affected by the same economic and industry conditions . for example , our retail segment experienced high occupancies and strong overall performance during 2003 , while our office and industrial segments reflected the weaker economic environment for those property types . the primary causes of the increase in rental income from continuing operations , with specific references to a particular segment when applicable , are summarized below : 25cf during 2003 , in-service occupancy improved from 87.1% ( 87.1 % ) at the end of 2002 to 89.3% ( 89.3 % ) at the end of 2003 . the second half of 2003 was highlighted by a significant increase in the industrial portfolio occupancy of 2.1% ( 2.1 % ) along with a slight increase in office portfolio occupancy of 0.9% ( 0.9 % ) . 25cf lease termination fees totaled $ 27.4 million in 2002 compared to $ 16.2 million in 2003 . most of this decrease was attributable to the office segment , which recognized $ 21.1 million of termination fees in 2002 as compared to $ 11.8 million in 2003 . lease termination fees relate to specific tenants that pay a fee to terminate their lease obligations before the end of the contractual lease term . the high volume of termination fees in 2002 was reflective of the contraction of the business of large office users during that year and their desire to downsize their use of office space . the decrease in termination fees for 2003 was indicative of an improving economy and a more stable financial position of our tenants . 25cf during the year ended 2003 , we acquired $ 232 million of properties totaling 2.1 million square feet . the acquisitions were primarily class a office buildings in existing markets with overall occupancy near 90% ( 90 % ) . revenues associated with these acquisitions totaled $ 11.9 million in 2003 . in addition , revenues from 2002 acquisitions totaled $ 15.8 million in 2003 compared to $ 4.8 million in 2002 . this significant increase is primarily due to a large office acquisition that closed at the end of december 2002 . 25cf developments placed in-service in 2003 provided revenues of $ 6.6 million , while revenues associated with developments placed in-service in 2002 totaled $ 13.7 million in 2003 compared to $ 4.7 million in 25cf proceeds from dispositions of held for rental properties totaled $ 126.1 million in 2003 , compared to $ 40.9 million in 2002 . these properties generated revenue of $ 12.5 million in 2003 versus $ 19.6 million in 2002 . equity in earnings of unconsolidated companies equity in earnings represents our ownership share of net income from investments in unconsolidated companies . these joint ventures generally own and operate rental properties and hold land for development . these earnings decreased from $ 27.2 million in 2002 to $ 23.7 million in 2003 . this decrease is a result of the following significant activity: ."," | 2003 | 2002 |

5141,what percent of foreign pretax earnings in 2008 were from discontinued operations?,50%,"the company is currently under audit by the internal revenue service and other major taxing jurisdictions around the world . it is thus reasonably possible that significant changes in the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits may occur within the next 12 months , but the company does not expect such audits to result in amounts that would cause a significant change to its effective tax rate , other than the following items . the company is currently at irs appeals for the years 1999 20132002 . one of the issues relates to the timing of the inclusion of interchange fees received by the company relating to credit card purchases by its cardholders . it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months the company can either reach agreement on this issue at appeals or decide to litigate the issue . this issue is presently being litigated by another company in a united states tax court case . the gross uncertain tax position for this item at december 31 , 2008 is $ 542 million . since this is a temporary difference , the only effect to the company 2019s effective tax rate would be due to net interest and state tax rate differentials . if the reserve were to be released , the tax benefit could be as much as $ 168 million . in addition , the company expects to conclude the irs audit of its u.s . federal consolidated income tax returns for the years 2003 20132005 within the next 12 months . the gross uncertain tax position at december 31 , 2008 for the items expected to be resolved is approximately $ 350 million plus gross interest of $ 70 million . the potential net tax benefit to continuing operations could be approximately $ 325 million . the following are the major tax jurisdictions in which the company and its affiliates operate and the earliest tax year subject to examination: . foreign pretax earnings approximated $ 10.3 billion in 2008 , $ 9.1 billion in 2007 , and $ 13.6 billion in 2006 ( $ 5.1 billion , $ 0.7 billion and $ 0.9 billion of which , respectively , are in discontinued operations ) . as a u.s . corporation , citigroup and its u.s . subsidiaries are subject to u.s . taxation currently on all foreign pretax earnings earned by a foreign branch . pretax earnings of a foreign subsidiary or affiliate are subject to u.s . taxation when effectively repatriated . the company provides income taxes on the undistributed earnings of non-u.s . subsidiaries except to the extent that such earnings are indefinitely invested outside the united states . at december 31 , 2008 , $ 22.8 billion of accumulated undistributed earnings of non-u.s . subsidiaries were indefinitely invested . at the existing u.s . federal income tax rate , additional taxes ( net of u.s . foreign tax credits ) of $ 6.1 billion would have to be provided if such earnings were remitted currently . the current year 2019s effect on the income tax expense from continuing operations is included in the foreign income tax rate differential line in the reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the company 2019s effective income tax rate on the previous page . income taxes are not provided for on the company 2019s savings bank base year bad debt reserves that arose before 1988 because under current u.s . tax rules such taxes will become payable only to the extent such amounts are distributed in excess of limits prescribed by federal law . at december 31 , 2008 , the amount of the base year reserves totaled approximately $ 358 million ( subject to a tax of $ 125 million ) . the company has no valuation allowance on deferred tax assets at december 31 , 2008 and december 31 , 2007 . at december 31 , 2008 , the company had a u.s . foreign tax-credit carryforward of $ 10.5 billion , $ 0.4 billion whose expiry date is 2016 , $ 5.3 billion whose expiry date is 2017 and $ 4.8 billion whose expiry date is 2018 . the company has a u.s federal consolidated net operating loss ( nol ) carryforward of approximately $ 13 billion whose expiration date is 2028 . the company also has a general business credit carryforward of $ 0.6 billion whose expiration dates are 2027-2028 . the company has state and local net operating loss carryforwards of $ 16.2 billion and $ 4.9 billion in new york state and new york city , respectively . this consists of $ 2.4 billion and $ 1.2 billion , whose expiration date is 2027 and $ 13.8 billion and $ 3.7 billion whose expiration date is 2028 and for which the company has recorded a deferred-tax asset of $ 1.2 billion , along with less significant net operating losses in various other states for which the company has recorded a deferred-tax asset of $ 399 million and which expire between 2012 and 2028 . in addition , the company has recorded deferred-tax assets in apb 23 subsidiaries for foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 130 million ( which expires in 2018 ) and $ 101 million ( with no expiration ) . although realization is not assured , the company believes that the realization of the recognized net deferred tax asset of $ 44.5 billion is more likely than not based on expectations as to future taxable income in the jurisdictions in which it operates and available tax planning strategies , as defined in sfas 109 , that could be implemented if necessary to prevent a carryforward from expiring . the company 2019s net deferred tax asset ( dta ) of $ 44.5 billion consists of approximately $ 36.5 billion of net u.s . federal dtas , $ 4 billion of net state dtas and $ 4 billion of net foreign dtas . included in the net federal dta of $ 36.5 billion are deferred tax liabilities of $ 4 billion that will reverse in the relevant carryforward period and may be used to support the dta . the major components of the u.s . federal dta are $ 10.5 billion in foreign tax-credit carryforwards , $ 4.6 billion in a net-operating-loss carryforward , $ 0.6 billion in a general-business-credit carryforward , $ 19.9 billion in net deductions that have not yet been taken on a tax return , and $ 0.9 billion in compensation deductions , which reduced additional paid-in capital in january 2009 and for which sfas 123 ( r ) did not permit any adjustment to such dta at december 31 , 2008 because the related stock compensation was not yet deductible to the company . in general , citigroup would need to generate approximately $ 85 billion of taxable income during the respective carryforward periods to fully realize its federal , state and local dtas. .","jurisdiction | tax year |
